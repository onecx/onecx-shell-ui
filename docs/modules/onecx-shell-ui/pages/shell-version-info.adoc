=== Shell Version Information

The shell supports a range of Angular versions across all environments. Supported package versions in any environment can be checked using the methods described below.

==== Primary Method: About Page

The preferred method to check shell version information is through the **About page** in the Shell UI.
The About page can be accessed by appending `/onecx-shell/about-shell` to your application's base URL:

`<application-base-url>/onecx-shell/about-shell`

**Examples:**

* Base URL: `https://myDomain.com/admin` → About page: `https://myDomain.com/onecx-shell/about-shell`
* Base URL: `https://myDomain.com/portal/admin` → About page: `https://myDomain.com/portal/onecx-shell/about-shell`

The About page displays comprehensive version information for all supported packages and can be accessed in any environment to verify deployed versions.

[NOTE]
====
The About page is only available in newer versions of the Shell. If you encounter an error when loading the page, please use the alternative Browser DevTools method described below.
====

==== Alternative Method: Browser DevTools

You can also use the browser's Developer Tools to access version information:

. Open your browser's Developer Tools
. Navigate to the Console tab
. Execute the following command:
+
[source,bash]
----
window['onecxWebpackContainer']
----
. Expand `default` and `angular-core`

This will display a list of all Angular versions that the shell is supporting. The displayed versions represent the maximum supported versions for each major Angular version - **any version less than or equal to the shown version (within the same major) is supported**.

==== Angular - Libs Version Compatibility

The following table outlines the compatibility between OneCX library versions and their corresponding Angular framework versions:

[cols="1,1", width="50%"]
|===
|OneCX Libs |Angular

|v5
|18

|v6
|19

|v7
|20
|===

NOTE: The major Angular version in the application determines which OneCX library version should be used. While all versions within the major are compatible, it is **recommended to use the lowest possible OneCX library version** that provides the required features and fixes.
